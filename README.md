# Cubism
Cubism is a Speedcubing timer for Web, Windows, MacOS and Linux.
# Notice
Cubism is barely functioning, and hastily being developed. Expect bugs! Currently, there is no error handling, it will be added in the release version, I am trying to add as many features as possible before improving stability. The code is also unclean, and inefficient. This will be improved before release, to be performant.
# Features
- Import from CSTimer
- Supports Web/Native
- Get averages
- [Random Moves] Scramble generator
